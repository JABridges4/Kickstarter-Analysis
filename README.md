# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis of kickstarter data to uncover trends

##Overview
  This analysis was conducted in order to see if when Kickstarters were created had an impact on whether on not they were successful. I also tested to see if the amount of money needed for the goal to be reached had an impact on success. The purpose of this analysis was to increase the probability that Louise would create a successful Kickstarter.

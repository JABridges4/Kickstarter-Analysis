# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis of kickstarter data to uncover trends

## Overview
  This analysis was conducted in order to see if when Kickstarters were created had an impact on whether on not they were successful. I also tested to see if the amount of money needed for the goal to be reached had an impact on success. The purpose of this analysis was to increase the probability that Louise would create a successful Kickstarter.
  
## Analysis and Challenges
 #### Part 1
 In order to complete the first part of this analysis I created a pivot table. This pivot table was filtered based on category, in order to isolate theater Kickstarter campaigns. This table had the months of the year in rows and the outcomes of the campaigns were the columns. I also included a line chart in this analysis to make it easier to visaulize the data. This chart featured months on the X axis and number of outcomes on the Y axis.
 #### Part 2
  For part two of the analysis I tested to see if the goal amount affected the success of a Kickstarter. To find this out I created a new sheet and in column A I put the amount of money for the goal in various ranges. I then used COUNTIFs function to see how many successful, failed, and canceled kickstarters there were for each range of dollar amounts, only counting the data from plays Kickstarters. For each dollar range I then calculated the precentage that was successful, failed, and canceled. Once again a line chart was generated to help visualize all of the data.
  ### Challenges
    One challenge that I ran into was during part one of the analysis. I created a line chart that adequately visualized the data but I was struggling to get the months to appear on the X axis. In order to solve this problem I had to go back into my chart and edit my data range by hand. Since the data was seperated by a few columns there was no way to highlight all of it at once, which is why only some of the correct labels initially appeared.
    
 ## Conclusions
 There are two main conclusions that can be drawn after looking at Outcomes vs Launch Date chart. The first is that theater Kickstarters are much more successful during the middle of the calender year, specifically in May, which had the most successful Kickstarters by a wide margin. Another conclusion is that theater Kickstarters are pretty effective in general, as the number of successful Kickstarters exceeded the number of failed ones in every month of the year. Another conclusion can be drawn from the Outcomes Based on Goals table. Based on this table we see that theater Kickstarters are much more likely to be successful if they ask for less money.
 ### Limitations and Alternatives
  A limitation of this data is that both of these tables were generated off of theater Kickstarter data. Therefore, we can not be positive if these conclusions would hold for all Kickstarters, or if they are exclusive to theater Kickstarters. an interesting way of continuing the analysis could be comparing our graphs of the theater category to another category, or even the rest of the data as a whole.
